# New Magellan Project 🚀

> Ryan @ May 2022

On the scale of the universe, there exists a labyrinth. This gigantic labyrinth, with a diameter of 17 billion light-years, holds the ultimate secrets of the universe on a planet with a mere radius of 100,000 kilometers. Humanity has no clues on how to find this planet.

Firstly, the biggest challenge is whether this planet and the ultimate truth it holds even exist. This premise might be purely fictional, yet there’s no way to prove or disprove it. Therefore, we can only name this hypothesis “faith.”

Next, assuming we continuously move in a specific direction, we will inevitably reach this “Star of Truth.” However, it might take several generations, or even the entire history of humanity, to reach it. Based on faith, the only feasible way is to establish this belief as humanity’s collective mission, allowing generation after generation to bridge the astronomical distance. This direction is rationalism; this steering wheel is the mission’s inheritance, and this spaceship is the collectivist system.

Secondly, we all know that this certain path doesn’t actually exist. How can humanity, without any information about the Star of Truth, expect its existence? As humans gazed into the universe, they first realized the unimaginable vastness of space, then the unimaginable continuation of time. As human cognition progressed, they conceived Plato’s Cave, only to discover that they were just a group of cave dwellers trapped in a four-dimensional space.

One day, humanity received a revelation from the Star of Truth, but they couldn’t understand its meaning at all. The symbols (grammar) used to express the revelation might not be isomorphic with any human language, let alone translatable. After prolonged and fruitless efforts, humanity realized that the thought patterns of the universal truth were entirely different from human brain structures. These thought patterns were like songs, poems, paintings, and riddles combined, ostensibly a cheat sheet from the beings on the Star of Truth favoring humanity, but ultimately an insurmountable gulf in symbols (language and thought patterns).

Finally, forced by survival, humans had no choice but to take the step off Earth. Before leaving their home planet, Earthlings reached only a few consensuses, probably the most rational agreements in human history:

	1.	Each spaceship decides how to explore, and the descendants of its members must build new ships to carry out their own exploration tasks independently.
	2.	Each spaceship is required to share their voyage logs and gained knowledge with all other ships; everything else is optional.
	3.	Ships must not interfere with each other. Each ship can decide to explore using its own theories and routes, or by adopting the theories and routes of other recognized ships. Success or failure will be determined by natural selection.
	4.	Each ship is equipped with an extremely simple yet incredibly powerful computer that only records the cumulative knowledge of all ships. It cannot help crew members discover new knowledge. Before the captain makes an exploratory decision, he must reference all historical human knowledge on the subject.

Although these are the simplest and perhaps the most foolish rules, they are likely the most reliable method for ensuring that among billions of ships over billions of years, one might eventually reach the Star of Truth.

Perhaps, when they finally reach the Star of Truth, a giant sculpture stands on the planet, depicting a chaotic, intertwined sphere of energy and information, inscribed with the following words:

> “Infinite time and space, extreme complexity, hidden dimensions, the singer’s melody, every species is insignificant before them.
> 
> Whoever reaches this star should know that the universal truth lies in the journey to this star.
> 
> That is—
> 
> Only evolution can contend with the infinite.”

## 新麦哲伦计划

在宇宙的尺度上，存在着一个迷宫，这个直径170亿光年的巨大迷宫，只有一个区区十万公里半径的星球上，保存着宇宙的终极奥秘，人类没有任何线索，该如何找到这个星球呢？
首先，最大的难题是这个星球以及星球上的终极真理，是否存在，这个前提或许都是虚构的，但却毫无办法去证明或证伪。因此，我们只能把这个假设起了一个名字叫信仰。
然后，假设朝向一个特定的方向持续前进，我们就必然会抵达这颗真理之星，但这或许是数代人，甚至整个人类历史都无法抵达的远处。但基于信仰，我们唯一能做且可行的方式，就是将信仰树立为人类的整体使命，让一代又一代人的生命延续，去征服天文尺寸的距离鸿沟。这个方向就是理性主义，这把舵盘就是使命传承，这艘飞船就是集体主义体制。
其次，我们都知道这条确定的路径根本不存在，一个连真理之星的丝毫信息都没有的人类，怎么可能奢求它的存在呢？人类将目光投向宇宙，先是意识到空间的巨大无法想象，然后意识到时间的延续无法想象，接着伴随着人类认知的进步，人类设想了柏拉图洞穴，却发现自己也只不过是一群困在4维空间的洞穴人。
有一天，人类收到了真理之星的启示，但人类完全无法理解启示的意义。因为，启示的内容表述所用的符文（语法）体系，可能和人类的所有语言都不是同构的，所以更谈不上翻译。经历了漫长的努力而毫无进展之后，人类意识到宇宙真理的思想模式和人类的大脑构造截然不同。他的思想模式是亦歌亦诗亦画亦迷一般，明明是真理之星人偏袒人类的作弊小抄，却成为了人类永远无法逾越的符文系统（语言及思想模式）鸿沟。
终于，人类迫于生存，只能硬着头皮迈出离开地球的一步，地球人在离开母星之前，唯一达成的共识只有区区几个，这应该是人类历史上最理性的共识吧：
1）每艘飞船各自决定如何探索，飞船成员的子孙必须打造新飞船独立执行探索任务。
2）每艘飞船只被要求，必须把航行日志和获得的知识收获分享给所有飞船，其他随意。
3）每艘飞船之间，不得干预其他飞船。每艘船都可以自己决定用自己的理论和航线，也可以使用认可的其他飞船的理论和航向进行探索。选对了就优胜，选错了就劣汰。
4）每艘飞船有一台极其简单，却又超级强大的电脑，只负责记录所有飞船汇总的所有知识，但无法帮助船员发现新知识，当船长做出一个探险决策之前，他必须将历史上所有人类曾经做过这个探索的知识提供给船长参考。
这虽然是最简单的规则，或许也是最笨的规则，但可以肯定，这是最有可能促使人类亿万飞船，经历亿万年之后，其中之一可能抵达真理之星的最靠谱的方法。
或许，当他抵达真理之星后，星球上竖立着一座巨大的雕塑，刻画了一个毫无规则，能量和信息相互纠缠形成的球体，他的上面刻着以下文字：
> 无垠的时空，极度的复杂，隐藏的维度，歌者的旋律，任何物种在他们的面前都渺小的不值一提。
> 凡抵达此星者理应尽知，宇宙真理尽在抵达此星之征程中。
> 那便是——
> 唯有进化对抗无限。
