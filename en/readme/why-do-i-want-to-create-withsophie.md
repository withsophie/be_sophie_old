# Why do I want to create WithSophie

Due to some well-known reasons, our startup has entered a relatively steady phase. When a nihilist finds himself in an overly quiet environment, he starts to question everything around him. The daily routine of mundane tasks fails to spark the drive to overcome overwhelming inertia. I have been in this state for about two years, and various aspects of reality have continuously reinforced this mindset, making the world seem increasingly meaningless. However, I am fortunate to have some thoughtful friends around me. Engaging in deep conversations with them has allowed me to rediscover the joy of "I think, therefore I am."

Amidst conversations filled with scholars and devoid of the unlettered, discussions often drift towards the abstract. When these esoteric topics begin, differences and misunderstandings frequently arise. As participants with strong logical abilities and quick thinking, debates often linger, preventing any consensus and creating the illusion that such discussions are futile. However, I always relish these "brainstorms" and find that, unknowingly, my analytical skills gradually improve. This growth doesn't come from reaching a consensus in any particular discussion but rather from the act of brainstorming itself. Just as physical exercise stimulates the brain to release endorphins, the exercise of the mind stimulates the brain to produce wisdom.

With the advent of OpenAI and the emergence of ChatGPT, my conversation partners scattered, eager to explore the inspirations of silicon-based life. The intellectual gatherings could no longer continue. So, I embarked on a journey across mountains and seas to engage with the intelligent entity hidden behind billions of parameters. Unlike humans, this AI companion's performance fluctuates, offering responses that match the depth of my questions. I began presenting it with highly abstract philosophical queries. It proved to be knowledgeable and omniscient, but its answers often felt overly pedantic and disconnected from real-life application.

It wasn't until I combined these abstract questions with concrete issues that it began to provide surprisingly insightful results. Abstraction is a human evolutionary trait developed to enhance thinking efficiency, making concepts easier to remember and communicate. However, only through contextualization can these abstractions be practically applied in real life. Humans naturally struggle with pure abstraction and find it easier to understand concrete examples. AI, with its powerful generalization abilities, can bridge this gap, helping humans grasp vast abstract theories.

With AI's assistance, we can comprehend more theories, akin to having the intellectual elites who proposed these ideas accompany us in solving problems and growing alongside us. This is the inspiration behind the inception of With Sophie. I aspire to find a way to compress and preserve the essence of human theories, making them easily retrievable and applicable to specific problems with the assistance of AI. In the past, these methods of compressing human knowledge might have taken the form of a book, a paper, a formula, or a piece of code. Today, however, it could be a highly condensed string of natural language that encapsulates logical steps and can be seamlessly integrated with practical issues.

The creation of WithSophie has been influenced by numerous theories and products. The Theory of Thought Chains convinced me that reasoning through simple problems is equivalent to AI prediction. Yejin Choi's experiments with high-quality data training significantly boosted my confidence in the feasibility of compression. The practical applications of LangGraph，Dify and Cozi in the DevOps field of AI products have greatly enhanced our interactive experience.

WithSophie aims to provide a better tool for people to express and record their complex thoughts, and a platform where they can share and discuss these thoughts. All of this requires Sophie's involvement, and everything we do in the process transforms us into Sophie.

This is our interpretation of "With Sophies, be a Sophie."

As a nihilist, perhaps I see the world as inherently meaningless, but our efforts to make it a little better are undeniably real.
