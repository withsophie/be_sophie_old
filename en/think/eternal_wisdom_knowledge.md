# The Wisdom of Eternal Life, the Knowledge of Eternal Life

Although GPT has not yet reached the level of AGI, perhaps human AGI is not as mysterious as it seems. What AI truly lacks is subjectivity, meaning there are no so-called subjective factors and the coherence of knowledge. In reality, each of us is a wisdom entity constrained by subjective and limited knowledge. I have never worried about what the proliferation of AI might bring to humanity. The first reason is that the trend is unstoppable. The second is that humanity has always been able to find a way out only through change. Throughout thousands of years of history, all human organizations that attempted to rely on fixed certainties and rejected new things have disappeared. Because outside the tribe there are other tribes, outside the religion there are other beliefs, outside the country there is the world, outside the land there is the ocean, and outside the Earth there is the universe. Any human force can only control certainty within its own system, but outside of any system there is a larger system. Therefore, believing in evolutionary systems will always keep the internal system dynamic, although there is also a significant probability of failure. It is this dynamism that makes the system inherently open, achieving rapid entropy reduction through energy and material exchanges with external systems, thereby keeping the system perpetually young. Once a system becomes stagnant, it is destined to become nourishment for external systems and will eventually be consumed. This cannot be attributed to the cruelty of others; it is the fundamental principle of entropy in the universe.

I once wrote a short essay called "The New Columbus Plan." The universe we live in is far more complex than we limited humans can understand. It may even be that this universe does not possess the simple and perfect cosmic code described in classical theoretical systems. Complex systems and evolution might be the essence and path of the universe.

Finally, I quote the epitaph inscribed on the stele of cosmic truth:

> In the boundless space-time, extreme complexity, hidden dimensions, and the melody of the singer, any species is insignificant in their presence. All who reach this star should know that the truth of the universe lies in the journey to this star.
> And that is—
> Only evolution can combat the infinite.

## 智者永生，知识永生

GPT虽然还没有AGI的程度，但或许人类的所谓AGI也没有那么玄妙，AI真正缺乏的是主体性，也就是没有所谓主观的因素，以及知识的自洽。我们每个人实际上，才是一个收到主观和有限知识约束的智慧体。我从来不焦虑AI的泛滥会给人类带来什么，第一是趋势无法阻挡，第二就是人类从来都只能是在变化中才能发现出路的。数千年的历史上，所有试图依靠固定确定性，排斥新事物的人类组织，都消失殆尽了。因为部落的外面有部落，宗教的外面有异教，国家的外面有世界，陆地的外面有海洋，地球的外面有宇宙。人类的任何力量，只能在自己的系统内部去控制确定性，但任何系统的外部都有更大的系统。所以，相信进化的系统，内部会始终保持活力，当然也会有巨大的失败概率。正是这种活力使得这个系统成为一个必然的开放系统，通过和外部系统的能量与物质交换，来实现系统自身的快速熵减，永葆系统的青春。而一旦故步自封，则注定自己的系统会成为外部系统的养料，最终被消耗掉。这并不能归因于别人的残酷，这是宇宙熵的第一性原理。

我曾经写过一篇小短文《新哥伦布计划》，我们生活的宇宙复杂到远远超过我们这些必然局限性的人类所无法理解的，甚至这个宇宙根本不存在经典理论体系中简介完美的宇宙密码，复杂系统和进化，或许才是宇宙的本质和路径。

最后引述这篇文章的最后，宇宙真理之碑上铭刻的碑文：

> 无垠的时空，极度的复杂，隐藏的维度，歌者的旋律，任何物种在他们的面前都渺小的不值一提。
> 凡抵达此星者理应尽知，宇宙真理尽在抵达此星之征程中。
> 那便是——
> 唯有进化对抗无限。
