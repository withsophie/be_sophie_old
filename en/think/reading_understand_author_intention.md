# Reading Should Aim to Understand the Author’s Intent

Many times, when we read, we do not consider the author’s intent, which can result in a lot of futile effort and even misinterpretation of the author’s original meaning. Therefore, before reading, it is very meaningful to fully understand the author’s writing motivation.

For example, nowadays many people use the teachings of Confucius and Mencius to improve their personal cultivation. Many scholars even explain the Analects and Mencius to ordinary people and children. However, if we delve into the original intent behind Confucius and Mencius writing these books, the content may not necessarily be suitable for the general public.

Confucius and Mencius, as representatives of the pre-Qin philosophers, wrote their books to sell their ideas on governance and statecraft to the rulers of their time. Therefore, much of the content is considered from the perspective of the rulers. If this perspective is ignored, some content might seem to be not in the interest of the common people. This is similar to a situation where a teacher’s reference answers are leaked to students before an exam, which is quite awkward. How did later scholars resolve this awkward situation? They could only reinterpret the texts.

Let’s take a specific example. The phrase “A man must be resolute and the words he speaks must be trustworthy,” often quoted from Confucius, is followed by another phrase “Such a man is a petty person” (Analects - Zilu). It means that being resolute and trustworthy is only required of petty people. But why is this only required of petty people? Confucius did not explain. Considering his intent for writing, it becomes easier to understand. He was telling the king to cultivate this quality of being resolute and trustworthy among the common people. No need for further explanation; the king would naturally get the benefit. Mencius, Confucius’s successor, spoke even more bluntly on this matter: “The superior man does not necessarily have to keep his promises or see his actions through to the end. Only righteousness matters” (Mencius - Li Lou II). Mencius believed that as long as it aligns with righteousness, a gentleman can lie and deceive. This was clear even to the foolish King Hui of Liang. Readers interested can see how later scholars tried to embellish Mencius’s words. Thus, reading without understanding the author’s writing motivation and spreading it as universal wisdom can cause great trouble.

I have written an excellent approach on WS, which analyzes selected chapters for readers based on the author’s intent, providing users with a new perspective on reading.

# 读书要洞悉作者的用意

很多时候，我们读书时完全没有考虑作者的用意，这会造成很多的无用功，甚至会曲解作者的本意，所以在阅读之前，如何充分了解作者的写作动机，也是非常有意义的事情。

举个例子，我们现在很多人在拿孔孟之道来作为提高自己个人修养的标准，很多国学家还在为普通人甚至小朋友讲解论语，孟子，但是如果深究当年孔孟著书时的用意，其实这本书中的内容未必适合普通人阅读。

孔子和孟子这些先秦诸子百家，著书立说的用意是在向当时的统治者兜售自己的治国理政理念的，所以书中有很多内容的角度是站在统治者层面思考的，如果忽略了这个角度，你会发现从人民的角度看，有些内容似乎是不符合民众利益的。这就好像一本给老师用的参考答案，在考试之前泄露给学生了一样，很尴尬的。那后来学者怎么缓解这尴尬的局面呢？就只能曲解了。

拿个具体的例子吧，孔子说的“言必行，行必果”，经常被大家传颂，但不知道后面紧跟着一句话“硁硁然小人哉”。（论语-子路）意思是说“言必行，行必果”只是对小人的要求。但是为什么这只是对小人的要求呢，他没说。结合他著书的用意来看，是不是就容易理解一些了呢？他是在告诉君王，你应该培养老百姓这个重合同守信用的品质和价值观。不用多解释，君王自然能get到其中的好处。孔子的接班人孟子，说话就比老前辈直白一些，他在此事上说的就更加的露骨：“大人者，言不必信，行不必果，惟义所在”（孟子-离娄章句下），就是说，孟子认为，只要符合道义，君子是可以撒谎骗人的。言至于此，即使傻如梁惠王，此时也就能完全明白其深意了。读者如果有兴趣，可以去看一看，后世的学者们是怎么去粉饰孟子的这句话的。所以说，读书不弄懂作者的写作动机，而又把它当作普适经典乱传播，会惹出很大的麻烦的。

我在WS上写了一个不错的思路，会根据作者写这本书的意图，来对读者选中的章节进行综合分析，给用户一个新角度的阅读体验。
